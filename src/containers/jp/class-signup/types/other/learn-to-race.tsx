		Sailboat racing can teach sportsmanship, teamwork, and responsibility. In addition to inspiring many with a lifelong passion for sailing, racing can vastly improve sailing ability. This Learn-to-Race class is three days long and will take place in our Cape Cod Mercuries. Sailors must have at least a Mercury Yellow rating, but more advanced racers and sailors are welcome and encouraged to join. For sailors who are interested in having fun and improving their skills, this Learn-to-Race class is a great place to start.
