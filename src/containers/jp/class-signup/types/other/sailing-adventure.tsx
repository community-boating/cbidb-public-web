Our instructors will pair up the Juniors at the beginning of each session, ensuring that they have a supportive partner to share their sailing adventure with. This partnership allows Juniors to collaborate and learn together, enhancing their sailing skills and building new friendships. The safety of our Juniors is our top priority. Our trained dockstaff on the shore and coast guard-certified safety launch operators ensure that all participants at Community Boating are well-protected throughout the class. Life jackets and safety briefings are provided to guarantee a secure and enjoyable sailing experience.
