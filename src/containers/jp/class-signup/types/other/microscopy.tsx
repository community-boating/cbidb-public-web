		The Charles River makes up a vibrant ecosystem, filled with microbial organisms. In this two-day course, students will undertake field studies and collect water samples in kayak based expeditions of the river. They will learn the basics of microscopy, including how to prepare samples on a slide and view them through a microscope. In so doing, students will be able to observe cyanobacteria, diatoms, dinoflagellates, and green algae species, many observing these microscopic species for the first time. Communities of microorganisms in biofilms will also be recovered by scraping boat hulls and observed microscopically.
