		Once your Junior takes the Intermediate Sailing class, the next step is to put those lessons to practice. There is a significant lag between understanding sailing concepts and being able to execute them on the water. While independent practice (also called free/open sailing) is a fantastic method to continue along this learning curve, this <b>Testing Clinic</b> is designed to provide two and a half hours of coached practice of the skills Juniors must demonstrate to receive their <b>Mercury Yellow, or Mercury Yellow Plus/Red Rating</b>. Juniors may receive a rating in this clinic if they earn it, which is the case in all of our classes.
