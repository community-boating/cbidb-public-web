		Intermediate 1 teaches new skills while polishing techniques introduced in Beginner Sailing. Sailing in pairs, students improve positioning, sail trim, maneuvers and control through a combination of lessons and structured play. This one-week class focuses on sail trim, boat handling, upwind sailing, and skills needed for heavier winds, including reefing. If students are ready, we introduce the Jib sail, encouraging teamwork and more fun!
