		The 420 is a quick, fun boat for a crew of two. This class covers how to rig and sail the 420 with a teammate. Sailors will also learn to right a capsize and be introduced to the basics of racing. Students should be prepared to get wet, so make sure to bring a change of clothes. While many sailors will receive their green 420 rating upon completion of this class, that will depend on their ability to effectively rig, sail and right the 420 on their own, which is a physical task but required for safe sailing.
