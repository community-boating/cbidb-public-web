		Keelboats are fun, fast, and allow larger groups to sail comfortably together. Lessons will be on our two larger keelboats; the Sonar and Ideal 18. Sailors will learn to rig, reef, launch from and return to our moorings, as well as applying their existing knowledge to a new and exciting fleet of boats. Most students will receive a green keelboat rating upon completion of this class.
