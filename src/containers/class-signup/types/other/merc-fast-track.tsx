		Our Fast Track class is designed to get a variety of experience level sailors up to speed on our Mercury sailboat and at our facility. Returning Learn-To-Sail students, sailors with experience in other boats and programs, and even sailors who want a refresher after their first week of Beginner Sailing may choose to take this as a first or second introduction to CBI's Junior Program. The class is on land, and includes abbreviated orientation, rigging, and shore school demonstrations.
