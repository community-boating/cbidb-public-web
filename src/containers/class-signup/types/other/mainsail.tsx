The Mainsail class focuses on polishing the skills learned in Learn-to-Sail (week 1). This class focuses on sail trim, boat handling, upwind sailing, and skills needed to sail in heavier winds Sailors are encouraged to practice their skills in open sailing. Sailors may test for their yellow rating when wind conditions warrant any time the Junior Program is open.
